# Analysis of Oahu's climate
## Project Overview
### Background
The [hawaii.sqlite](https://github.com/elp192/Surfing/blob/3a9586527e67f052c1907bc453e387250a8a6433/hawaii.sqlite) is a data source that includes two tables (i.e., measurement and station). The measurement table consists of 5 columns (i.e., id, station, date, prcp, and tobs) and 19550 rows. The station table includes 6 columns (i.e., id, station, name, latitude, longitude, elevation) and 9 rows (number of stations). The data was gathered from 2010 to 2017. Analysis of climate in Oahu, Hawaii, using this dataset helps us to undrestand whether opening the surf and ice cream shop is economical during whole months of the year.
